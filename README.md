THE MEAN
Mean is the simple mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.

THE MEDIAN
  The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending list of numbers and can be more 
descriptive of that data set than the average. It is the point above and below which half (50%) the observed data falls, 
and so represents the midpoint of the data.
Method 1
  When the scores are ordered from lowest to highest and there are an odd number of scores, the
middle value will be the median score.
Method 2
  When the scores are ordered from lowest to highest and there are an even number of scores,
the point midway between the two middle values will be the median score.

THE MODE
  The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values. If X is a discrete random variable, 
 the mode is the value x at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, 
 it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.
 
THE VARIANCE
  Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean.
 Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value
 
Example:
Samples of student grades in Griffith University:
6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6
+ The MEAN is (6+5+4+5+7+6+6+5+6) / 9 = 5.56
+ Sort it:
4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7
Median = 6
+ How many of each value are there?
4: 1, 5: 3, 6: 4, 7: 1
The MODE is 6
+ Variance
is simply the average of the squared differences from the mean
Example: what is the variance of the dataset (6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6)?
First find the mean: (6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6)/9 = 5.56
Now find the differences from the mean:
(0.44, -0.56, -1.56, -0.56, 1.44, 0.44, 0.44, -0.56, 0.44)
Find the squared differences:
(0.19, 0.31, 2.43, 0.31, 2.07, 0.19, 0.19, 0.31, 0.19)
Find the average of the squared differences: (0.19+0.31+2.43+0.31+2.07+0.19+0.19+0.31+0.19) / 9 = 0.69

NUMERICAL DATA
• Represents quantitative measurement
• Heights of people, page load times, stock prices, 
etc.
• Two types:
• Discrete Data: integer based; often counts of 
some events
• How many purchases did a customer make in a 
year?
• How many times did I flip “heads”?
• Continuous Data: has an infinite number of 
possible values
• How much time did it take for a user to check out?
• How much rain fell on a given day?

CATEGORICAL DATA
• Qualitative data without
inherent mathematical meaning
• Gender, yes/no (binary data), race, 
state of residence, product 
category, political party, etc.
• Compact representation: assign 
binary to categories 
• Without mathematical meaning

ORDINAL DATA 
• A mixture of numerical and 
categorical
• Ordinal data that has mathematical 
meaning
• Example: movie ratings on a 1-5 
scale
• Ratings must be 1,2,3,4, or 5
• These values have mathematical 
meaning
• 1 means it’s a worse movie than a 2.

TEXTUAL DATA 
• Huge amount of diverse textual data produced every second for wide 
range of sources

GRAPH DATA
• E.g. social networks
