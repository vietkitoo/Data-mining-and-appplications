#The Mean
Mean is the simple mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.
#
#The Median
  The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending list of numbers and can be more 
descriptive of that data set than the average. It is the point above and below which half (50%) the observed data falls, 
and so represents the midpoint of the data.
Method 1
  When the scores are ordered from lowest to highest and there are an odd number of scores, the
middle value will be the median score.
Method 2
  When the scores are ordered from lowest to highest and there are an even number of scores,
the point midway between the two middle values will be the median score.

#The Mode
  The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values. If X is a discrete random variable, 
 the mode is the value x at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, 
 it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.
#
#The Variance
  Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean.
 Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value
 
Example:

Samples of student grades in Griffith University:
6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6

+ The MEAN is (6+5+4+5+7+6+6+5+6) / 9 = 5.56

+ Sort it:
4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7
Median = 6

+ How many of each value are there?
4: 1, 5: 3, 6: 4, 7: 1

The MODE is 6

+ Variance

is simply the average of the squared differences from the mean

Example: what is the variance of the dataset (6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6)?

First find the mean: (6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6)/9 = 5.56

Now find the differences from the mean:

(0.44, -0.56, -1.56, -0.56, 1.44, 0.44, 0.44, -0.56, 0.44)

Find the squared differences:

(0.19, 0.31, 2.43, 0.31, 2.07, 0.19, 0.19, 0.31, 0.19)

Find the average of the squared differences:

= (0.19+0.31+2.43+0.31+2.07+0.19+0.19+0.31+0.19) / 9 = 0.69
