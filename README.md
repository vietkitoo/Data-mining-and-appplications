#The Mean
Mean is the simple mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.

#
#
#The Median
  The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending list of numbers and can be more 
descriptive of that data set than the average. It is the point above and below which half (50%) the observed data falls, 
and so represents the midpoint of the data.

Method 1
  When the scores are ordered from lowest to highest and there are an odd number of scores, the
middle value will be the median score. For example, examine the following set of scores:
  7, 9, 12, 13, 17, 20, 22

  Because there are seven scores and 7 is an odd number, then the middle score will be the
median value. Thus, 13 is the median score. To check whether this is true, look to see whether
there is exactly the same number of scores above and below 13. In this case, there are three
scores above 13 (17, 20, and 22) and three scores below 13 (7, 9, and 12).

Method 2
  When the scores are ordered from lowest to highest and there are an even number of scores,
the point midway between the two middle values will be the median score. For example, exam-
ine the following set of scores:
  2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10
  There are six scores, and 6 is an even number; therefore, take the average of 5 and 6, which
is 5.5, and that will be the median value

#The Mode
  The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values. If X is a discrete random variable, 
 the mode is the value x at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, 
 it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.

#The Variance
  Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean.
 Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value
